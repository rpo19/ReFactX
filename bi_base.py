RELATION_DESCRIPTION = """
The facts use these relations:

- 'has role in' / 'role held by': Indicates that one entity has a role in another (e.g., a person is CEO of a company). This does not imply ownership or control.

- 'owns minority' / 'owned by (minority)': Indicates that the subject owns less than 50% of the other entity.

- 'owns majority' / 'owned by (majority)': Indicates that the subject owns 50% or more of the other entity.

- 'controls' / 'controlled by': Indicates that the subject has control over the other entity, usually implying significant ownership or influence.

- 'ultimately controls' / 'ultimately controlled by':
  Indicates that the subject is the ultimate or final controller of the other entity, possibly through intermediate layers.

- 'has holdings in' / 'held by': Indicates that the subject holds a stake or interest (e.g., voting rights) in the other entity, not necessarily through share ownership.
