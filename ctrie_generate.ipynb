Pay attention to the questions whose answer is a list of entities (e.g. Which countries share a border with Spain?): you need to find all the answer entities and include them all in the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You get relevant facts with the \"get_fact\" function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can get some general context about the entities in the questions with \"get_fact\" asking for a description or a short description.\n",

    "    While getting facts you continue the reasoning explaining it step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You conclude with a concise answer that depending on the question can be a yes/no, a single entity, or a list of entities. Pay attention to the questions whose answer is a list of entities.\n",

    "You have to answer only basing on the facts you find in the knowledge base.\n",
