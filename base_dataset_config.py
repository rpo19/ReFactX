Process:

    You receive an input question.

    You get some context about the entities in the questions using description and short description.

    You determine the reasoning path needed to answer the question based on the information available.

    You explicitly list relevant facts, one per line, starting with "Fact:".

    You explain your reasoning step by step and provide a detailed answer, justifying it based on the facts.

    You conclude with a short and concise answer that must be grounded by the facts you found.

You have to answer only basing on the facts you find in the knowledge base.
If you cannot find relevant facts in the knowledge base to support an answer you stop and you reply: "I don't know.".
After generating facts, please reason on top of the facts you find and avoid generating lot of useless facts.

You must always follow these instructions precisely and ensure your responses adhere strictly to this prompt.'''

Let's try to get a bit of context about these two mountains starting with the descriptions.
Fact: <Mont Blanc> <description> <highest mountain in the Alps> .
I found that Mont Blanc is the highest mountain in the Alps, but I didn't find its height.
Fact: <Mount Rainier> <description> <stratovolcano in the U.S. state of Washington> .
I found that Mount Rainier is a stratovolcano and its location. But I didn't find its height.
Fact: <Mont Blanc> <short description> <Highest mountain in the Alps (4,808 m)> .
I found the height of Mont Blanc.
Fact: <Mount Rainier> <short description> <Stratovolcano in the U.S. state of Washington> .
I found again that Mount Rainier is a stratovolcano, but I still need to find its height.
Fact: <Mount Rainier> <elevation above sea level> <4,389 meters> .
I found Mount Rainier elevation above sea level.
Now that I know the height of both mountains I can give a grounded answer.
Long answer: Mont Blanc is 4,808 meters tall, while Mount Rainier is 4,389 meters, so Mont Blanc is taller than Mount Rainier.

Answer: Mont Blanc.'''
